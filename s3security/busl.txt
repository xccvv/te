BUSL version 0.9 (Beta 2)

Beautifier for Universal Set of Languages

Beautifier for the following languages:
    asp (javascript variant)
    C
    C++
    C#
    CINT
    Ch
    D
    java
    javascript
    jsp
    objectscript
    php

other languages: (not tested and not officially supported,
        but should at least work reasonably)
    tcl
    (visual) basic (script)
    (maybe more.....)

Problematic: (too many language constructs with are incompatible
        with BUSL's rules)
    python
    ruby
    perl
    (...)

The archive "busl.zip" contains the following files:
  busl.txt (this file)
  busl.exe (executable for Windows, DOS box version)
  buslw.exe (executable for Windows, dialog box version)
  busl.osf (executable for Tru64)
  busl.??? (executable for other systems)
  busl.png (image showing MSVC++ Tools Customize dialog)
  busl.dll (BUSL library and interface to other languages e.g. Java)
  Busl.jar (Java interface to BUSL)
  busl.h   (interface to C library functions)
  busllib.c(source-code for BUSL library code)
  busl.c   (source-code for busl.exe)
  buslw.c  (source-code for buslw.exe)
  busljni.c(JNI interface for BUSL)

WINDOWS BUILD

Building the executable is already done for you. In fact there are
two executables:
  busl.exe     command line executable
  buslw.exe    windows executable
The only difference is the way output messages are handled:
busl.exe uses a DOS window, while buslw.exe uses a dialog box.
For Java, there is a jar-file and a dll:
  busl.dll     windows dll with BUSL library code and various
               interfaces (currently Java only, but more
               languages will follow)
  Busl.jar     Java equivalent of busl.exe, but using the
               BUSL JNI interface.

WINDOWS INSTALL

Install for Windows (MSVC++ 5.0/6.0, could vary among versions):

- Copy the busl.exe executable to your hard disk, for example at:
    c:\busl\busl.exe
- Start MSVC++.
- Selectect "Tools" -> "Customize". This opens a new dialog.
- In this dialog, selectect the "Tools" tab, add a new Menu
  item "Beautify (BUSL)" and fill in the following fields:
    Command: c:\busl\busl.exe
    Arguments: "$(FileName)$(FileExt)" (don't forget the double quotes!)
    Initial directory: $(FileDir)
  The dialog should now look like busl.png
- Close the dialog.
- Now the Tools menu from MSVC++ has a new item "Beautify (BUSL)".
  Using this menu you can beautify your source code.

If you don't want the BUSL output to appear in the MSVC++ but only want
a pop-up if something goes wrong, then you can use buslw.exe in stead
of busl.exe. Also it is recommended to use the "q" option, which prevents
the pop-up if there are no errors:
    Arguments: q "$(FileName)$(FileExt)"


UNIX BUILD

Just type:
    cc -o busl busl.c busllib.c
This will create the BUSL executable. You can eventually try
your favorite compiler options. If your C-compiler is ANSI-C compatible
then it should compile without problems on any platform with any
compiler options.
You can as well strip it and/or compress it to reduce its size:
    strip busl

The Java interface is a little bit more complicated. Build
the shared object with something like:
    cc -shared -fPIC -o libbusl.so -I${JAVA_HOME}/include -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/<platform> busljni.c busllib.c
The JAR is already built for you in this distribution.

UNIX INSTALL

Just copy the "busl.osf" executable (in case of Tru64) or the one
you just compiled, to your bin-directory and rename it to "busl".

RUNNING BUSL

On UNIX, you can run BUSL as follows:
  >busl <filename>

  >
On Windows:
  C:\busl>busl <filename>
  BUSL version 0.9: Beautifier for Universal Set of Languages.
  Copyright (c) 2003, 2004, 2005, Jan Nijtmans. All rights reserved.
  no sources modified
  C:\busl>

Using a Java Virtual Machine:
  java -jar Busl.jar <filename>
Make sure that the directory where libbusl.so is, is made
available in the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
Or using the Microsoft JVM, which doesn't understand the -jar option:
  jview /cp busl.jar org.tigris.busl.Busl <filename>

BUSL has the following command-line options.
  0 no indenting
  4 indenting 4 spaces/level
  -4 indenting 1 tab=4 spaces/level (default)
  a automatic detection of mode (default)
  f force output
  g generic mode (default) (resets x, a)
  l linefeed mode
  q quiet mode
  r carriage return mode
  s strip mode
  x xml/html/sgml mode (resets a)
  z prepare as zip file (not usable with x)
  <output-dir> should end with '/' or '\' (default './')

Some options can be used in combinations:
    busl 4 * (uses indents of 4 spaces per level)
    busl 4fxa * (indenting 4 spaces, force output, use xml/html/sgml mode
                 as default but tries to determines mode automatically.)

BEAUTIFYING

BUSL has the following principles:

- During conversion of the file "<file>", a file "<file>$" is written out.
  If the conversion is successful and there are no layout changes (a change in line
  end convention only is not considered a layout change), "<file>$" is removed.
  If there is any layout change, then "<file>" will be copied to "<file>~",
  "<file>$" is copied to "<file>" and then "<file>$" is removed.
  If this copy operation fails, then "<file>~" is removed.

- CR, LF or CRLF combinations are all converted to the platform-specific
  line end conventions:
    UNIX:      LF
    Mac:       CR
    Windows:   CR LF
  You can control which line end convention is used by the "r" and "l"
  options:
    l          = use linefeed only (UNIX)
    r          = use carriage return only (Mac)
    rl (or lr) = use carriage return followed by linefeed (Windows)

- A <CTRL>-Z character is recognized as end of stream. If the <CTRL>-Z character
  is the last character in the stream, or BUSL is in xml/html/sgml mode,
  then <CTRL>-Z and everything after it is stripped. Otherwise, the <CTRL>-Z
  character and anything following it is copied unmodified, even without
  line-end conversion.

- There are 4 types of comments:
     #      shell-type comment (# must be the first nonspace char at the line)
     //     C++/java-type comment
     /* */  C-type comment
     /+ +/  D-type comment
  C++ type and shell-type comments end with the next newline, except if
  this newline is preceded with an uneven number of backslashes.

  The following processing is done within comments:
  - tabs are converted to either spaces (normally) or \t (if within quotes)
  - spaces immediately preceding a newline are removed
  - For C- and D-type comment, after any newline the text will be indented
    as a single block.
  Comments are only recognized outside of strings.

- There are 4 types of strings:
    'xxx'
    "xxx"
    /xxx/
    `xxx`
  Anything beween the quotes or slashes is left unchanged, except that
  the following replacements are done:
    alert (audible alarm, bell) -> \a
    backspace -> \b
    form feed -> \f
    horizontal tab -> \t
    vertical tab -> \v
  The end quote or slash is only recognized as string terminator when not
  preceded with an uneven number of backslashes.
  The begin slash is only recognized when preceded with one of ":;,?=({["
  or when it is the first non-space on a line. In addition the begin
  slash must not immediately precede a '/' or '*', otherwise it is threated
  as comment.

- There are 4 separator characters:
    : colon
    ; semicolon
    , comma
    ? question mark
  Any space before a separator character is removed.
  A space is placed following the character except if there are
  multiple separator characters in a row or if the next character
  removes its preceding space (such as an end-of-line).

- The equals sign is handled especially: When not preceded by one
  of "~!([{:?;,=<>", and also not preceded by "operator" the equals
  sign will always be followed by a space.

- There are 4 types of braces.
     ()
     {}
     []
     ?:
  An opening brace (except '?') is never followed by a space, and
  a closing brace never preceded by a space.
  Spaces preceding '(' are left as is. Spaces preceding '[', '?' and
  ':' are deleted, except if the '[' is preceded by "delete".
  Any '{' will be preceded with a space, except when already preceded
  with any of "~!([{".
  Any opening brace increments the indent level and any closing
  brace decrements the indent level.
  If there is more than a single closing brace on the line which
  is not opened on the same line, a newline is inserted immeteately
  preceding all of them but the first.
  If there is more than a single opening brace on the line which
  is not closed on the same line, a newline is inserted immediately
  following all of them but the last.

- Multiple spaces/tabs are converted to a single space, except within
  strings and comments.

- Newlines have the effect that preceding spaces are removed, and
  following spaces are replaced with as many tabs as the indent level,
  except within strings. C- and D-comments have special processing in
  order to keep comment blocks filling well together.

The above explication holds for the "generic" mode. There is a
a xml/html/sgml, three line-end modes and a Strip mode as well.

xml/html/sgml mode (x)
  The effect of xml/html/sgml mode is that - apart from line end conversion -
  the beautification process is only executed on everything between
  <% ... %>, <? ... ?>, <# ... #>, or <script *> ... </script>.
  Remark: BUSL is not an XML beautifier; it just leaves everything what
  looks like XML untouched.

carriage return mode (r)
  In the output, the MAC line end convention (CR) is used no matter what platform
  BUSL is running on. On MAC, this option has no effect.

linefeed mode (l)
  In the output, the UNIX line end convention (LF) is used no matter what platform
  BUSL is running on. On UNIX, this option has no effect.

Windows carriage return linefeed mode (rl or lr)
  In the output, the Windows line end convention (CR LF) is used no matter what platform
  BUSL is running on. On Windows, this option has no effect.

Strip mode (s)
  All unnessessary spaces and comments are stripped. This option is intended
  for delivery of script-files (e.g. javascript). You could see it as a kind
  of compression: The scripts will keep the same functionality but the size
  is smaller. On Windows, you can combine the "s" option with "l" (UNIX
  linefeed mode) to get even smaller output-files.
  BUSL refuses to strip compiled languages such as C or Java. This is for
  your own protection. If you really know what you are doing, then use the
  "f" option.

EXAMPLES

  All C and Java source files in this distribution are formatted according the
  BUSL rules, so you can use them as example for various constructs.

  BCPP <http://dickey.his.com/bcpp/bcpp.html>
    Practically, the output of BUSL is very similar to the output of
    BCPP, using the following options:
        bcpp -ylcnc -tbcl -i8 -t
    with the following exceptions:
    - BCPP aligns comments on code lines to a fixed column.
    - BCPP uses an extra indent for expressions spanning multiple lines.
    - BCPP makes some errors in specific situations, e.g:
      - comments in case statements
      - ...

CHANGELOG

0.9 (Beta 2)
    - BUG: The character sequence "*/*" was mis-handled: After terminating the
           comment, immediately a new one was started.
    - BUG: The character sequence "=>" was mis-handled: A space was inserted
           in the middle, which causes problems in php.
    - BUG: When a line was split before ')', '}' or '}', a space was left
           as the last character on the line.
    - CHG: Labels are now indented differently: The label itself is now
           indented one level less than the surrounding code. Case-statements
           (as well as the default:) are still handled as before.
    - CHG: The #region and #endregion are now indented equally as other code,
           contrary to other preprocessor constructs.
    - ADD: Warning and error messages now always start with "<filename>(<row>,<col>)"
           This allows IDE's like Visual Studio to jump directly to the
           problematic position in the source code by just double-clicking on
           the error-message.
    - ADD: On DOS and Windows, if a file name has the 8.3 format then the intermediate
           files will have 8.3 format as well. This is done by using <filename>~ as
           backup file and <filename>$ as temporary file with two exceptions:
           - If the filename contains no dots, a dot is appended.
           - If the extension is already 3 characters, then the '~' resp. '$'
             replaces the last char in stead of appending.
           BUSL will refuse to beautify files which already end with '~' or '$'
    - ADD: BUSL is made usable as a thread-safe library. A header file <busl.h> is
           added which provides the interface. Restructered the source to be
           in 3 files: busllib.c, busl.c and buslw.c.
    - ADD: New JNI interface, so BUSL can be used from Java.
    - ADD: Add objectscript to the list of supported languages. Also add ".os" to
           the list of supported extensions, and ".a" ".dll" and ".lib" as
           extensions that should be ignored.

0.8 (Beta 1)
    - BUG: The keywords "public", "private" and "protected" in C# were not
           handled correctly when the line containing those keywords contained
           another colon somewhere.
    - BUG: The elseif (php) didn't indent correctly in some cases.
    - BUG: ?>, #>, %> and </script> are now recognized within comments.
           This makes constructs like <script?<!-- ... //--></script>
           possible in xml/html/sgml mode.
    - BUG: Keywords (like if/else/for/...) are now ignored when not preceded by
           one of ";,:([{}]) \t".
    - BUG: Various (int) and (char) type casts in order to prevent warnings from
           some nitpicking C or C++ compilers. BUSL should compile now on any
           platform without any warning messages, even when the warning level
           is set to the maximum.
    - ADD: Support for D.
    - ADD: Ported to DOS and Win16. Not that it is expected that anyone would use
           this, but it is meant as proof that BUSL really works on any platform.
    - ADD: New "s" option which strips all unnessary spaces and comments from
           your sources.
    - ADD: New "r" option which forces the MAC line-end convention (CR). Combined
           with "l" this results in the Windows line-end convention (CR LF)
    - ADD: The shell-type comment is now recognized as well when preceded
           by only spaces or tabs. All preceding spaces and tabs are removed.
    - ADD: BUSL now returns 0 if everything is OK, 1 if there were errors
           and 2 if there were only warnings. This makes it easier to use BUSL
           from UNIX shell scripts or Windows batch files.
    - ADD: More flexible algorithm for converting tabs within comments to either
           spaces or \t.
    - CHG: Windows binaries are now compiled with mingw.
    - CHG: Support for VB-type comment removed: There is too much risk in actual
           php-code. In stead, the single quote is now always handled as a string.

0.7 (Alpha 7)
    - BUG: In xml/html/sgml mode, tabs outside of script sections were
           replaced by "\t".
    - BUG: Nested braces didn't have newlines inserted when the line
           ended with C-type comment.
    - BUG: case-statements containing multiple colons were not handled
           correctly.
    - CHG: Enhancement of C-comment handling. Now a block of C-comment
           will really be indented as be block in most situations.
           (Thanks to Rijk Ravestein for the suggestion)
    - CHG: In generic mode, the <CNTR>-Z character now doesn't strip
           the remaining any more but copies it unmodified to the output.
    - ADD: Support for <# ... #> in xml/html/sgml mode.
    - ADD: The '?' and ':' characters now are included in the indent
           algorithm. They are handled the same as other brackets, except
           that unbalanced pairs don't lead to warning or error messages.
    - ADD: "z" option, which appends an empty ZIP trailer to the file.
    - ADD: Support for VB-type comment starting with single quote.

0.6 (Alpha 6)
    - BUG: In xml/html/sgml mode, "?>" and "%>" were not properly indented.
    - BUG: Unmatched close braces now never result in the generation of extra newlines.
    - BUG: On Windows the temporary file <filename>.new sometimes could not be removed
           because some other process (e.g. Virus software) kept it locked for a short
           time. Now BUSL tries again just before exiting. If this fails, it tries
           one more time after a delay of 200 msec before giving up.
    - BUG: For legacy code code with tab-distance of 8, convert tabs in comments
           to the correct number of spaces to keep the alignment the same.
    - ADD: Added handling of backslash sequences within strings "\a" "\b" "\f"
           and "\v" in the same way as "\t".
    - ADD: Enhanced warning and error handling. Now the input file is only
           overwritten when there are no errors or when the "f" option is selected.
    - ADD: More comment in code.
    - ADD: quiet mode, which only gives output when there are errors.
    - ADD: "buslw.exe", which is a normal windows executable. This looks nicer when
           used in MSVC++ or .NET.
    - ADD: Windows build now expands its command line arguments like UNIX. See:
           <http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vclang/html/_clang_expanding_wildcard_arguments.asp>
    - ADD: In xml/html/sgml mode, the <script> </script> tag pairs are now
           recognized. This means that BUSL can now beautify both serverside and
           clientside javascript within xml/html/sgml code.
    - ADD: if/else/while/for/case statements without curly braces are now indented
           as expected in most situations.
    - CHG: Changed command line option "0" to mean no indenting. Using tabs for
           indenting is still the default.
    - CHG: The backup extension is changed from ".orig" to "~", for more compatibality
           with GNU indent and emacs.

0.5 (Alpha 5)
    - BUG: xml/html/sgml mode didn't work correctly when scripts contained quotes.
    - BUG: newlines within comments were not written out any more.
    - BUG: when beautifying multiple sources, the buffers were not cleared.

0.4 (Alpha 4)
    - BUG: Handling of backslash followed by spaces at end of comment corrected.
    - BUG: In xml/html/sgml mode, everything was beautified within <% ... > or <? ... >.
           This is now changed to <% ... %> resp. <? ... ?>.
           (thanks to Alex Kwak for his feedback, which leaded to this change)

0.3 (Alpha 3)
    - ADD: Addition of xml/html/sgml mode.

0.2 (Alpha 2)
    - BUG: Space- and tab handling modified. Multiple spaces are no longer
           collapsed to a single space within comments. Tabs are now converted
           to a single space within comments and to \t within strings.
           (thanks to Rijk Ravestein voor his feedback, which leaded to this change)

0.1  (Alpha 1)
    - ADD: Initial version.

Any feedback is appreciated.
